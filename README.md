Math - Probability:
- 152 - given n numbers and n probabilities that sum to 1, write function to generate one of the number with its corresponding prob

Math:
- 70 - given pos integer n, return nth perfect number (digits sum to 10)
- 74- num times x appears in n-by-n mult table
- 129 - given real number n, find square root of n
- 138 - find min number of coins to make n cents
- 150 - given list of points, central point, and int k, find nearest k points from central point
- 156 - given pos int n, find smallest number of squared ints which sum to n

Intervals:
- 21 - given array of time intervals for classes, find min rooms required
- 77 - return list of intervals where all overlapping intervals have been merged
- 119 - given set of closed intervals, find smallest set of numbers that covers all intervals
- 191 - find min num intervals to remove to make rest of intervals non-overlapping

Chess, backtracking:
- 38 - N queens problem
